# ⏳ Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet & Hybrid Model

This project demonstrates time series forecasting using both statistical and deep learning models — ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet — along with a Hybrid approach that combines their strengths. The notebook includes model implementation, evaluation, and visualization. It also features a Gradio-based UI for interactive forecasting.


## 🚀 Features

- 📈 Forecasting models implemented:
  - ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory - Neural Network)
  - Prophet (by Meta/Facebook)
  - Hybrid (Average of ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet)
- 📊 Evaluation Metrics:
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - MAPE / SMAPE
- 🖥️ Tools & Libraries:
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Gradio (for user-friendly UI)
  - Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Keras, Prophet
